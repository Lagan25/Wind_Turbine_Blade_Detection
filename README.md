An image recognition model based on a deep learning network is proposed for the automatic extraction
of image features and the accurate and efficient detection of wind turbine blade damage. 
In order to improve the recognition performance of the proposed deep learning model, transfer learning and an ensemble learning classifier are used in a convolutional neural network model.
With the fast improvement of wind electricity technology, in current years, a huge variety of wind generators were hooked up and placed into use. 
Since maximum wind generators are hooked up in complex and vicious environments and undergo the impact of alternating masses for a protracted time, 
wind generators revel in severa faults. Maintenance and restore of those faults growth the operational price of the wind generators and reduce their lifestyles cycle. 

This project proposes the fault detection anomaly and detects the images of the surface blades of the wind Tuebine that are defected or Faulty, and provides a 
accurate value of the fault classes. In this project we use a Multi-Class Classsification of Data set that has 4 subclasses of defects.
Image processing involved specifically with image recognition and image classification has taken a huge stride with the advent of high-performance GPUâ€™s and the increase in the processing speeds of images by the computer systems. n different classes of images has helped in solving issues which can be addressed by huge number of 
annotated datasets in teaching a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the images.
